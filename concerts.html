<p>The Capital Chamber Choir is starting its 2016-2017 season by embarking on its first ever major recording project, centred on local and Canadian composers, made possible by a grant from the <a href="http://www.arts.on.ca/" target="_blank">Ontario Arts Council</a>. Look for more information about the release in the new year!</p>

<p>Our season features collaborations with renowned local musical institutions. On November 11, 2016, we will be singing <a href="https://oryc.ca/events/remembrance-day-concert-with-oryc-and-the-capital-chamber-choir/" target="_blank">Brahms&rsquo; Requiem in support of the Ottawa Regional Youth Choir</a>, and we will return to Southam Hall in May 2017 to perform <a href="http://nac-cna.ca/en/event/13674" target="_blank">Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem</a> with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, under the direction of John Storg√•rds.</p>

<p>Our regular season concerts in December 2016 and March 2017 will continue to offer the best in contemporary choral music.</p>

<p>Finally, in June 2017, the Capital Chamber Choir will take part in <em>Sing Ottawa en choeur</em>, a weekend-long choral celebration in honour of Canada's sesquicentennial.</p>

<p>We're looking forward to this exciting and eventful season, and we hope you'll join us on this journey!</p>
