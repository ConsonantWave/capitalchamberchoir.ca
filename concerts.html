<p>The Capital Chamber Choir's 2014-15 season features a busy slate of five concerts, including our first performance away from Ottawa. We will be performing programmes of diverse repertoire, collaborating with other local ensembles and musicians, and, as always, showcasing some of the finest music Canada (and Ottawa!) has to offer. Be sure to mark your calendars!</p>
