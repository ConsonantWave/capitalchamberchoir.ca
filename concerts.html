<p>This season, the Capital Chamber Choir is looking forward to taking on new challenges and bringing exciting works of contemporary music to wider audiences.</p>

<p>We will make our National Arts Centre debut in November 2015, joining with other local ensembles to premiere Anna Sokolovic's Golden Slumbers with the NAC Orchestra. We will also return to the NAC in February 2016 to perform the Brahms Requiem.</p>

<p>Our regular season concerts in December 2015 and May 2016 will highlight the exceptional works of three of the most exciting choral composers writing today: Ēriks Ešenvalds, Paul Mealor and Tarik O'Regan.</p>

<p>Finally, in July 2016, we will be taking the show on the road, performing a concert at St. George's Cathedral in Kingston as part of the Royal Canadian College of Organists Annual Convention. We look forward to showcasing some wonderful works for choir and organ, and reprising Nicholas Piper's acclaimed Delight of Paradise, which we premiered last season.</p>

<p>Needless to say, we are incredibly excited to perform such dynamic and diverse repertoire, and we hope you’ll join us on this journey!</p>
