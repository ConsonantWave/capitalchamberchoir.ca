Since its inaugural year, the ensemble has been committed to showcasing a wide range of Canadian choral music, performing works by Timothy Corlis, Eleanor Daley, John Estacio, Steven Gellman, Srul Irving Glick, Frédéric Lacroix, Jocelyn Morlock, Donald Patriquin, Nicholas Piper, Imant Raminsh, R. Murray Schafer, Mark Sirett, Nancy Telfer, and Healey Willan, among others.
