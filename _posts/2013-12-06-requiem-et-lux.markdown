The Capital Chamber Choir presents _Requiem et Lux_ Friday, December 6, 2013, 8pm, at Knox Presbyterian Church. As we look forward to the winter solstice and the holiday season, this concert will mark the transition from darkness to light with works by Gjeilo, Howells, Lauridsen, Whitacre, and Canadians Glick, Matthews, Morlock, and Togni.
