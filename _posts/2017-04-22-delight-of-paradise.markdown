Join us on April 22 to celebrate the official release of The Delight of Paradise, the Capital Chamber Choir's all-Canadian debut album. 

This fabulous cocktail soirée will include canapés, a cash bar, live performances of album highlights, and plenty of opportunity to mix and mingle!

About The Delight of Paradise:    
The Capital Chamber Choir is committed to showcasing Canadian, local, and contemporary choral music. For our debut album, we have selected exclusively Canadian repertoire, including works by six Ottawa-based composers.
