Our annual cocktail soiree &mdash; Capital Chamber Choir: On the Rocks With a Twist! &mdash; raises funds to support the ensemble's continued growth. This year, this event will be held at Sidedoor (18 York Street, Ottawa), which Maclean's magazine recently named one of the country's best restaurants! The evening begins at 7:30pm and includes performances by the ensemble, canapes, a silent auction, as well as a cash bar. Tickets are $40 and are available in advance only; they can be purchased from a choir member, at _The Leading Note_ or [online][1].
