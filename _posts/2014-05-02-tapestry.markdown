The Capital Chamber Choir marked its fifth anniversary with Tapestry &mdash; a celebration of Canadian choral music &mdash; on Friday, May 2nd at 8pm. 

This exciting programme featured works by Canadian composers Stephen Chatman, Eleanor Daley, Trevor Grahl, Imant Raminsh, Mark Sirett and Healey Willan. The choir was particularly thrilled to present pieces by local composers Tony Dunn, Timothy Mott, Kelly-Marie Murphy, Nicholas Piper, and Lucas Schuller. 

The concert was held at Knox Presbyterian Church (120 Lisgar Street).
