      <h1>Capital Chamber Choir</h1>
      <h2>2011-2012 Auditions</h2>

<p>Auditions will be held at All Saints' Anglican Church, 317 Chapel Street (at Laurier Avenue). Audition dates are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tuesday, August 22nd, 5pm to 7pm</li>
  <li>Sunday, August 28th, 2pm to 4pm</li>
  <li>Friday, September 9th, 5pm to 7pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:director@capitalchamberchoir.ca">director@capitalchamberchoir.ca</a> to request a date and time!</p>
<p>Auditioning choristers are asked to prepare one vocal selection to present at the time of their audition. This may be a solo piece of their own choice, or alternatively, they may prepare a choral excerpt from our upcoming programme. This excerpt will be sent out via email in early August.</p>
<p>Please review the calendar below. It is important to have full commitment to these dates from all choristers. Sectional rehearsals are in addition to our regular schedule. With the exception of our first kick-off event, Saturday, September 24th, they are not mandatory though attendance is <strong>very</strong> strongly encouraged. Please note that dress rehearsals and concert call times are also considered mandatory.</p>
<p>A reminder of our attendance policy agreed upon at our last AGM: choristers agree to a maximum of <em>2 missed rehearsals</em> per concert. Should missed rehearsals exceed this limit, the chorister is responsible for scheduling an additional rehearsal with the director.</p>
