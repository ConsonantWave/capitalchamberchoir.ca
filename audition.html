<h3>Audition requirements</h3>
<p>The audition will consist of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prepared Solo</strong>: You are asked to prepare <em>an excerpt of a vocal selection</em> of your choice. This selection may be a solo or a choral piece. It may be performed a cappella or with piano accompaniment. An accompanist will be provided at no expense for the audition. Should you wish to rehearse with the accompanist before the audition, the choir manager will provide you with the accompanistâ€™s email.</li>
    <li><strong>Sight Reading</strong>: You will be asked to sight-read a short excerpt. The expectation is that this excerpt will be performed with correct pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and text. This portion of the audition will not be accompanied; however a tuning note will be given.</li>
    <li><strong>Ear Training</strong>: You will be asked to aurally identify various chord qualities (major, minor etc.) and basic intervals.</li>
</ul>
