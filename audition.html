<p>The Capital Chamber Choir is holding auditions for talented, experienced singers of <strong>all voice types</strong> to join our ensemble for the 2017-2018 season.</p>
<p>Interested? Please send an email to <a href="mailto:amy@capitalchamberchoir.ca">amy@capitalchamberchoir.ca</a> with your voice type, availability from September 2017 - July 2018, and your preferred audition session. If you are unable to attend one of the listed audition sessions, an alternative time can be arranged. Interested singers will be provided with additional information about the ensemble and the upcoming season.</p>

<h3>Audition location</h3>
<p>St. Joseph's Parish (151 Laurier Ave East)</p>

<h3>Audition requirements</h3>
<p>Singers will need to prepare three short choral excerpts that will be sent prior to the audition date. The
choral excerpts are in SATB format and you are asked to prepare the part that best demonstrates your
voice range and technical capabilities while performing in front of an audition panel. Excerpts are to be
performed a cappella. There will also be a short sight reading test and scales. You will not need to provide an accompanist.</p>

<p><strong>We sincerely thank you for your interest in our ensemble. We look forward to hearing from you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nous acceptons aussi les chanteur(e)s francophones!</strong></p>
