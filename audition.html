<p>The Capital Chamber Choir is holding auditions for talented, experienced singers of <strong>all voice types</strong> to join our ensemble for the 2016-2017 season.</p>
<p>Interested? Please send an email to <a href="mailto:amy@capitalchamberchoir.ca">amy@capitalchamberchoir.ca</a> with your voice type and your preferred audition session. If you are unable to attend one of the listed audition sessions, an alternative time can be arranged. Interested singers will be provided with additional information about the ensemble and the upcoming season.</p>

<h3>Audition location</h3>
<p>St. Joseph's Parish (151 Laurier Ave East)</p>

<h3>Audition requirements</h3>
<p>Interested singers will be sent an excerpt from a choral piece in SATB format one week prior to the audition date. You should prepare the part that best corresponds with your voice type, which you sing as a solo in front of our audition panel. There will also be an additional sight reading test, and singers may be asked to sing scales to demonstrate their vocal range.</p>

<p><strong>We sincerely thank you for your interest in our ensemble. We look forward to hearing from you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nous acceptons aussi les chanteur(e)s francophones!</strong></p>
